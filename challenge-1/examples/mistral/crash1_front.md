## Description of Incident

On the morning of July 17, 2025, my vehicle was legally parked in a market parking space at 2325 Main Street, Springfield. At approximately 8:30 AM, while I was inside a nearby store, I was notified by a witness that a gray pickup truck attempting to park beside my car, struck the front end and driver's side of my vehicle. The other car's driver failed to properly judge the distance and collided with my vehicle, causing significant damage. The other driver left their information and waited for the police to arrive.
