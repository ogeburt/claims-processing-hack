**Description of Incident**
On July 18, 2025, at 4:10 PM, I was driving eastbound on Madison Avenue in Albany, New York. While proceeding through a green light at the intersection with Parkwood Street, another vehicle traveling southbound failed to stop at the red signal and struck my vehicle and heard on the driver's side. My car span partially as a result of the impact before coming to a stop near the curb. The force of the collision crumpled both the driver's door and rear door, bent the frame at the center pillar, and damaged the rear wheel. The doors can no longer open normally and the rear window on the driver's side the vehicle. Emerging services responded to the scene; the other driver admitted fault to the police and then details were recorded.
