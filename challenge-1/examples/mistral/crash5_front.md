## Description of Incident

On July 19,2025, I was driving my car eastbound on Bethel Road in Columbus, Ohio. At 2:50 PM, as I entered the intersection at Karl Road, a gray pickup truck traveling northbound forward to yield while marking a left turn and struck the rear drive side of my vehicle. The force of the impact spun my car, causing extensive damage to the left rear panel am bumper. Other driver remained at the scene and called local police.
