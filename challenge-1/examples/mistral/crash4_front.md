## Description of Incident

On July 19, 2025, at approximately 11:15 AM, I was driving my 2011 Show Outback westbound on Westbrook Road in Dayton, Ohio. While waiting in line with traffic for a stop sign, my vehicle was rear-ended by a blue sedan at moderate speed. The impact pushed my vehicle into the adjacent lane and forced my front end into the left lane's shoulder. The other driver remained at the scene and promptly called local authorities. A police report was filed.
